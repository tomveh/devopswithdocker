Some of the buttons did not work because the frontend was calling localhost:8000 to reach the backend.

This was fixed by adding a new port mapping 8000:8000 to the docker-compose file and a new server block to the nginx.conf that passes requests from localhost:8000 to localhost:80/api (which are passed to backend:8000).
